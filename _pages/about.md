Hej, everyone! I'm Floor van Donkelaar, a computational astrophysicist and *Herchel Smith Postdoctoral Research Fellow* at the *Institute of Astronomy*, University of Cambridge, where I study galaxy formation and evolution, with a focus on late-type galaxies like our Milky Way at high redshift. I previously completed my PhD at the University of Zürich in the group of Prof. Dr. Lucio Mayer.

> **Main research interests:** The formation and evolution of galactic components in disc galaxies at high redshift and the role of stellar clusters by means of (cosmological) simulations.

With my research, I hope to gain a clearer understanding of these processes by delving into various aspects of galactic structures. This includes investigating galactic structures such as stellar clumps, intermediate mass black holes, the galactic centre, stellar migration, disc formation, gas accretion, and much more. Currently, I'm studying the fate of thin discs formed at redshift above 4 using the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..106T/abstract">GigaEris</a> cosmological, N-body hydrodynamical “zoom-in” simulation. And the properties and formation of high-redshift high-stellar-mass clumps, and probable formation paths for little red dots using the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...961...76M/abstract">MassiveBlackPS</a> simulation. Additionally, I'm beginning pre-work on developing a subgrid model specifically designed for high-redshift star clusters within massive galaxies and galaxy clusters. The <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250704927V/abstract">Phoebos</a> simulation, a completely new large-scale cosmological simulation modeling a ∼100 cMpc volume of the Universe, is now out, so be sure to check it out!

My academic journey led me to Switzerland after completing my master’s degree in astrophysics at Lund University in Sweden, and my bachelor’s in sociotechnical engineering (with a minor in modern physics) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.

In my spare time, I’m passionate about public relations, especially when it comes to social media. I’m genuinely fascinated by how these algorithms work and I enjoy the challenge of trying to outsmart them. Over the years, I’ve taken on a variety of roles in this area, including some voluntary positions. Outside of my passion for PR, I’m an avid rugby fan and a true Dutch cycling enthusiast. I love being on my bike, even if it was on the Swiss hills. The asphalt in the United Kingdom takes some getting used to though.
