Hej, everyone! I'm Floor van Donkelaar, a computational astrophysicist and *Herchel Smith Postdoctoral Research Fellow* at the *Institute of Astronomy*, University of Cambridge, where I study galaxy formation and evolution, with a focus on late-type galaxies like our Milky Way at high redshift. I previously completed my PhD at the University of Z√ºrich in the group of Prof. Dr. Lucio Mayer.

> **Main research interests:** The formation and evolution of galactic components in disc galaxies at high redshift and the role of stellar clusters by means of (cosmological) simulations.

With my research, I hope to gain a clearer understanding of these processes by delving into various aspects of galactic structures. This includes investigating galactic structures such as stellar clumps, intermediate mass black holes, the galactic centre, stellar migration, disc formation, gas accretion, and much more. Currently, I'm studying the fate of thin discs formed at redshift above 4 using the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928..106T/abstract">GigaEris</a> cosmological, N-body hydrodynamical ‚Äúzoom-in‚Äù simulation. And the properties and formation of high-redshift high-stellar-mass clumps, and probable formation paths for little red dots using the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...961...76M/abstract">MassiveBlackPS</a> simulation. Additionally, I'm beginning pre-work on developing a subgrid model specifically designed for high-redshift star clusters within massive galaxies and galaxy clusters. The <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250704927V/abstract">*Phoebos*</a> simulation, a completely new large-scale cosmological simulation modeling a ‚àº100 cMpc volume of the Universe, is now out, so be sure to check it out!

My academic journey led me to Switzerland after completing my master‚Äôs degree in astrophysics at Lund University in Sweden, and my bachelor‚Äôs in sociotechnical engineering (with a minor in modern physics) at the University of Twente in the Netherlands.

In my spare time, I‚Äôm passionate about public relations, especially when it comes to social media. I‚Äôm genuinely fascinated by how these algorithms work and I enjoy the challenge of trying to outsmart them üôÉ. Over the years, I‚Äôve taken on a variety of roles in this area, including some voluntary positions, which you can check out on <a href="https://fvandonkelaar.github.io/outreach/">this page</a>. Right now, I manage the public relations and graphic design for the women‚Äôs rugby team at Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich Rugby, where I‚Äôm also an active player. Outside of rugby and PR, I‚Äôm a true Dutch cycling enthusiast  love my bike and have even grown to enjoy the challenge of cycling uphill here in Switzerland.
