While I am passionate about researching galaxy formation and evolution, it's not my only interest. Public outreach has always energized me, and in the future, I would love to combine these two interests and get people enthusiastic about astronomy and science as a whole. To this end, I have already given several talks at <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/alumni/events/2023/9/1097040/twente4tu-alumni-event-zurich-27th-september-2023"> alumni events </a> for my undergraduate university, sharing the wonders of astronomy. In addition, I’m currently supervising a Master’s student from ETH Zurich on their semester project, which focuses on the properties of star-forming gas clouds at high redshift.

      <h2>Alumni Ambassador </h2>
      <p> As an active alumni member, I’ve participated in several groups and initiatives. After graduating from Lund University, I became an Alumni Ambassador, advising incoming students on making the most of their time at Lund.</p>
      <p> Additionally, I served as Chair and PR Manager for the <a href="https://www.uct-alumni.nl/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0073e6;">UCTAA</a> from 2021 to 2022, where I strengthened alumni networks and introduced initiatives like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/alumni-abroad-z%C3%BCrich-uct-alumni/?trackingId=ChQcwT%2FRSM%2BFqWZYVT4vGg%3D%3D" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0073e6;">alumni blogs</a> to share member experiences worldwide. </p>

      <h2>Rugby Community</h2>
      <p>    In the past I have channeled my outreach skills into another passion: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gczurichvalkyries" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0073e6;"><em>Rugby</em></a>. I've served as the public relations manager and graphic designer for previous teams. In this role, I've 
    successfully doubled our social media followers and boosted engagement by 40%. </p>
